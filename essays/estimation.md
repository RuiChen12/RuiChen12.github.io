## 1. How did you make your effort estimates?

I made my effort estimates based on whether I had done similar tasks before. If I had experience with something similar, I would look at how much time it took me last time and then subtract a bit. For example, when I worked on the PictureSwitcher component on the landing page, it took me about 30 minutes to finish. So, since I had done it before, I estimated it would take 20 minutes next time.

But if I hadn’t done something like that before, I would try to guess based on how much work I thought it would be. For example, when I created the Club page, I thought that just creating a simple page and doing some basic formatting would only take about 60 minutes or maybe even less.

## 2. Even though your estimates were always off, sometimes way off, was there any benefit from making effort estimates for the issues in advance? If so, what benefits? If not, why not?

I think there is definitely some benefit, but maybe not a huge one. Estimating in advance helps with time management, but when you're facing a problem you've never solved before, it's really hard to guess how much time it will take.

For example, like I said before, I created the Club Page. In the beginning (Milestone 1), we only made a mockup, and there was no real data, so it matched my estimate. But estimating something means I plan what I want to do and guess the time based on that. However, when we start building, we often get new ideas and want to add more features — and that part can't be estimated. So this makes the real-time difference from the estimate.

Also, when we work on things we've never done before, the estimate can be way off. For example, in Milestone 2, we tried to connect real data (like from Vercel) to the mockup page. I thought I could finish the database setup in 45 minutes because we did similar stuff in the digits assignment. But that was all on a local database.

With Vercel, it's different. Only one person was managing the database, and others couldn’t connect to it directly. On local databases, if we run db actions, they usually don’t give errors. But on Vercel, sometimes Prisma parameters couldn’t be found in dbaction, so it would cause errors.

To see those errors, we had to keep merging into the main branch again and again. And sometimes, the error was just a small thing — like a wrong parameter name, or an eslint error. But each time, we had to wait for testing and still might not fix it. This wasted a lot of time and caused a big gap between estimated and real effort.

## 3. Was there any benefit for tracking the actual effort expended on the issues? If so, what benefits? If not, why not? Was there any downside to estimating and tracking your effort? If so what?

I think tracking the actual time was helpful because it gave me a better idea of future estimates. After finishing a task, I could compare the real-time with what I guessed before. This helped me learn how to estimate more accurately next time.

As for the downsides, I don’t think there were any big ones. Tracking and estimating didn’t really slow me down or cause problems. Sometimes it took a bit of extra time to check the clock and write it down, but it was worth it.
## 4. How did you track your actual effort? How accurate do you believe your tracking was?
I tracked my actual effort by checking the time when I started and when I finished. But sometimes, if I was almost done or already halfway through and had more free time, I would let myself keep going and add extra time. I usually started at a round number, like 5:00 PM, and ended on a 15-minute mark, like 5:15, 5:30, 5:45, or 6:00.

I don’t think my tracking was very accurate because it was hard to tell the difference between coding work and non-coding work. For example, thinking about new features, checking for bugs, or waiting for tests to finish — it’s hard to count those separately. But I also think there’s not much point in trying to separate coding and non-coding time exactly.
## 5. How much overhead was there in tracking your effort? Did it take up a noticeable amount of time or inhibit you working on the project?
Tracking effort didn’t really give me any extra burden, because I didn’t actually separate my work into coding and non-coding parts. After I finished a task, I would just give an estimate of how much time was coding and how much was non-coding, but it probably wasn’t very accurate.

I don’t think there’s much benefit in splitting everything into coding and non-coding work, so I didn’t try too hard to do that.
