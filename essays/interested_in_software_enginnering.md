*Exploring My Passion for Software Engineering and Future Aspirations*

Software engineering has always fascinated me because it combines creativity and problem-solving to build solutions that impact the world. From games to web applications, I am drawn to the endless possibilities of designing systems that improve people's lives. My journey into this field started with a love for games, and as I explored programming in high school and university, my interest grew stronger. Through hands-on projects and real-world experiences, I have discovered the joy of creating, learning, and overcoming challenges.

## Discovering My Interest in Software Engineering

My first steps into software engineering began with my childhood passion for games. In high school, I dreamed of making my own game and decided to take a programming course. Python was the first language I learned, and I used it to create a project called Aircraft Fight Game. With the help of YouTube tutorials, I taught myself how to use Pygame and built a 2D shooter game where players control an aircraft to defeat enemies. Completing this project—from designing gameplay to debugging code—was incredibly satisfying and showed me the power of programming to bring ideas to life.

Later, I explored mobile app development with React Native, which introduced me to concepts like user authentication, database integration, and dynamic interfaces. At first, I struggled with small but frustrating challenges, like figuring out how to add free icons to my app. However, I learned to overcome these difficulties through persistence. Each small victory strengthened my passion for software engineering and encouraged me to dive deeper into this exciting field.

## Building on Early Foundations in University

When I entered university, I wanted to gain professional experience and apply my skills in real-world settings. During my first semester, I attended a career fair hoping to find an internship but was disappointed to learn that most opportunities required junior standing. Instead of giving up, I focused on building my skills and eventually joined the UH Groupings project.

At UH Groupings, I worked as a web developer, learning React and Next.js to create responsive web applications. I also collaborated on backend development using Java to refactor APIs, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. This experience taught me how software can solve real-world problems by improving workflows and enhancing user experiences. Overcoming challenges, such as debugging complex features and quickly learning new frameworks, helped me grow as a developer and boosted my confidence in solving technical problems.

## Future Goals and Areas of Growth

Looking ahead, I want to deepen my knowledge in web development and focus on creating applications that are efficient, secure, and user-friendly. While I have experience building dynamic user interfaces with React and Next.js, I want to explore progressive web applications (PWAs), which provide features like offline functionality and push notifications to enhance user engagement.

On the backend, I aim to strengthen my understanding of technologies like Node.js to build high-performance, real-time applications. Additionally, web security is an area I am eager to explore further. I want to learn how to build secure authentication systems and prevent vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) or SQL injection to ensure user data is protected.

By expanding my skills in these areas, I hope to create applications that are not only fast and reliable but also safe and accessible to users. These goals reflect my commitment to growing as a software engineer and contributing to meaningful projects in the future.
